# Interim_Project_Airbnb  (Generation Singapore JDE02)

This report documents the work of our group, Dream Team, where we used publicly available
data from Inside Airbnb, an advocacy group, to replicate the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
process typical of data engineering. To draw insights from our data, we also carried out data
analysis and visualisation tasks.
